# Video-Transcription-using-BART-Transformer-Model
Built a generative AI system that converts 1–3 minute videos into concise textual summaries using OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text transcription and a BART transformer for abstractive summarization. Preprocessed real-world videos from YouTube and lectures, achieving high accuracy as evaluated with ROUGE metrics.
